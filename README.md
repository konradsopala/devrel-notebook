**Developer Relations** is about building trust at scale. Before you start diving into this repo we just want you to remember one thing: **Developer Relations is a JOB AND NOT a LIFESTYLE**. Don't be mislead by all those DevRel people constantly tweeting. Although charisma can be faked, DevRel requires genuine enthusiasm for your platform or product, so let's start learning!

**Developer Relations Team**

### DevrelTeam

Here are some notes on building successful DevRel Teams. There are three key roles that you need in your devrel team:

* **The Evangelist**
 * Just as the name suggests, these are the people who stand on stages and preach to thousands of developers about a particular tool or product that makes building software worthwhile. They are the PR face of the company and attend various conferences and meetups to share information about a product, collect first-hand feedback and show off killer slides with memes.

* **The Facilitator / Educator**
 * Developers need the materials behind your product – from documentation to quick start guides. This is what facilitators and educators do; they provide the backbone support for developers to enable them to find their way around your product. You’ll also find them running technical training events and speaking at workshops and meetups. They may not be the most outgoing of the bunch but their product knowledge and knack for making complex topics digestible is priceless.

* **The Organiser**
 * They act as fuel to the community that you’re building around your product – maintaining peace and prosperity in the community, making sure that any issues raised are sorted out ASAP and rewarding the various great people in the community for their contributions.

**Have that in the back of your head: Developer Relations is hard to measure, subjective and time-intensive**
