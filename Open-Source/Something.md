### 1. Code of Conduct

#### We at Auth0

Our core philosophy is based on the principles of collaboration, experimentation, learning, transparency and passion.

**Our Values**

![](/Open-Source/Assets/Auth0Values.png)

You can read about [our company values in more detail here.](https://auth0.com/careers/culture)

Our **values** guide us in our day-to-day interactions and decision-making. Our open source projects are no exception. Trust, respect, collaboration and transparency are some of our core values we believe should live and breathe within our projects. With this, our community needs to welcome all participants - who come from around the world, who have different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

#### Purpose

Organizers, maintainers, contributors, and users of Auth0 open source projects are kindly asked to read through and embrace our code of conduct and to pledge to respect all people regardless of level of experience, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual identity and orientation, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality. We invite all those who participate in our projects to help us create a safe, open, and welcoming community for everyone.

Examples of behavior that contributes to welcoming behavior:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Attempt collaboration before conflict
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unwelcoming behavior that will not be acceptable:
* Violence, threats of violence, or inciting others to commit self-harm
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention, advances or touching
* Trolling, intentionally spreading misinformation, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Abuse of the reporting process to intentionally harass or exclude others
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### 2. Reporting Guidelines

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In the event that we determine that a public statement will need to be made, the identities of all reporters will remain confidential.

#### Unsure if the incident is a violation?

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to <mark>**still report it**</mark>. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may result in an individual or group to feel like they can no longer participate in the community. Reports deemed as not a violation will also allow us to improve our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report even if you are only an observer.

#### The report

Please include the following in the report:
* Individuals involved (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms). If there are other witnesses, please try to include them.
* Your contact info so that we can follow up.
* When and where the incident occurred.
* Your view of what happened.
* Is the incident ongoing?
* Optional: Any extra context or information you believe to be pertinent to the incident.
Links are appreciated.

The report to be submitted in this anonymous form: https://goo.gl/forms/gl6gjl1n6EhMbMc32

#### What's next?

If you have provided contact information we will follow up acknowledging the receipt. Once the incident has been assessed an outline of how the incident was handled will be shared with the reporter.

This outline may include:
* What steps were taken to assess the situation.
* How we determined the incident constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Whether the incident constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Resolution, may be one of the following:
  * A statement explaining why no action needs to be taken
  * A statement outlining that the reportee has agreed to cease this type of behavior
    * If a warning is issued, any further incident of the same nature will be escalated
  * A permanent or temporary ban from some or all spaces deemed part of the community

  A private or public apology will not be encouraged as we would like to respect the safety and not expose the reporter to have further contact with the reportee.

#### Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration of the resolution. To make a request, please contact [INSERT CONTACT FORM HERE] and your request will be reviewed.

### 3. Enforcement Manual

The enforcement manual describes the processes involved in responding to an issue and ensures a consistent and fair process.

#### How reports are responded to

**Responding Procedure**
* Gather further information if required before taking any action
* Assess the impact and risk of further harm (consequences)
* Determine resources needed
* Address the incident
* Follow up with people affected
* Record full details and resolution

**Assessing**
* How many people are affected?
* Is it dangerous if this happens again?
* Does the incident involve repeat offenders?
* Are there legal requirements involved?

**Post-responding**
* How did it go?
* What did we learn?
* Do we need anything next time?
* Is there anything we haven't resolved?

All information, deliberation, and processes will be recorded.

### FAQ

#### Why a Code of Conduct?

We developed a Code of Conduct (CoC) that builds upon widely adopted ones, like http://citizencodeofconduct.org/ and https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ (which for example is used by Ruby https://rubyonrails.org/conduct/ and thousands of other open source projects), because we wanted to ensure it incorporated and reflected the values and standards we have at Auth0. Being an online community we have the great privilege of having members come from far and wide, from all walks of life. However, this can also lead to communication issues and conflict. We wanted to be proactive about providing a positive and healthy environment for which participation, discussions, and contributions can take place free of unwelcoming behavior. Our CoC aims to establish expectations for behavior, to prevent unwelcoming behavior, and to set the ramifications involved when this type occurs. This will enable us to foster a safe and healthy social atmosphere and to empower a constructive community space. We do not merely want an environment that is free from hostility; we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive. An inclusive and diverse community will have more innovative ideas, integrate unique perspectives, and produce more quality code.

#### Where does the CoC apply (scope)?

*Does the CoC only apply in the repository (issues and PRs)?*

We expect all community participants (users, members, mentors, founders, contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to this community. This includes the community forum, newsletters, Auth0 events, and any other spaces where community members communication could affect a person's ability to participate.
This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring <mark>**outside**</mark> the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

#### Who does it apply to?

This CoC outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community. Community members includes, but is not limited to, users, members, contributors, sponsors; and other guests.
