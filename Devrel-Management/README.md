### General

In this section, there will be a few concepts, models and smaller thing presented that we considered meaningful, from the perspective of DevReal Team manager or even DevRel org head. Others not working on managerial positions should also find it helpful in order to understand over-arching goals of the whole DevRel structure in their company.

The first thing is **AAARRRP Model** by [Phil Legetter](https://twitter.com/leggetter)

The other one is **DevRel Pillars 3 C's Model**, which consists of three key elements

* Code
* Content
* Community

Next one is understanding DevRel and its fields as a whole but also split into smaller fields. Those two assets by [hoopy.io](https://hoopy.io/) should make it all clear.

### DevrelManager

If you want to become a successful Devrel team / org , Developer Product Manager try to incorporate those thoughts:

* There should be a right balance between KPIs / dashboards and interacting and listening to developers
* Make users better at what they want to do not thinking what you want them to do
* Developers don't have much time
* Upgrade your users not your product
* They want to hack your product to their usecases
* There is no point trying to fix something that your organisation doesn't want to fix
* Public Roadmaps - by sharing in advance what you’re planning with your users, you can help them make much smarter long-term decisions
* Take a look at customer requests, and analyse them carefully. You want to distinguish between what customers ask for, and what they actually need

Apart from all that do not forget about constant growth, crafting and executing a vision and above all empowering your team!

### BusinessModels

Based on Hoopy.io State of Devrel Report organizations that practice DevRel fall into two business models:

* **Developer First**: the primary business model of the company is B2D (Business to Developer). For example, Stripe and Twilio.
* **Developer Plus**: a company's primary business model is B2B or B2C, but a developer play, extends or supports the primary business model. For example: Slack, Spotify, Apple.

### KPIs

This applies to pretty much everyone, not only managers. If you don't measure your efforts and performance you don't know if you make progress. Without a quantifiable sense of where you are vs. where you were, you can’t know (in any meaningful way) whether you’ve succeeded or not.

Remember that the number itself isn’t the goal — it’s the process of tracking them over time and finding patterns in the data that can inform project and process improvements. Not everything you can measure, should be measured. Don’t be a data puker, be a data analyst. Be laser focused on the things that matter & provide actionable insights
